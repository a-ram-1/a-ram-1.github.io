<p>Hi, I'm A. I'm a PhD student in Yale's <a href=https://cbb.yale.edu/>Computational Biology and Bioinformatics</a> program working with <a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/">Forrest Crawford</a> and <a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/frederick_altice/">Rick Altice</a>. I'm currently working on multiple projects related to opioid use, with the aim of identifying policy and targeted healthcare interventions that could reduce the incidence of fatal overdose. I've also worked on <a href=https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/29/2/404/6375720?guestAccessKey=e585ef2b-9900-40ad-a21f-ece3b18feaf9>projects</a> related to trans healthcare.</p> 

<p>Before coming to Yale, I did my BS and MEng in <a href=http://www.eecs.mit.edu/>Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a> at MIT. You can reach me at a[dot]ram[at]yale[dot]edu. I'm particularly interested in talking to anyone working on matters surrounding harm reduction, incarceration, abolition and social determinants of health.</p>
