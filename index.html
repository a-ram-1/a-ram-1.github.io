<p>Hi, I'm A. I'm a PhD student in Yale's <a href="https://cbb.yale.edu/">Computational Biology and Bioinformatics</a> program working with <a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/">Forrest Crawford</a> and <a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/frederick_altice/">Rick Altice</a>, among others. My work aims to curb the incidence of opioid-related overdose deaths in CT by identifying opportunities for enhanced surveillance and means by which harm reduction workers can more impactfully engage high-risk users with comorbidities such as HIV. In the past I've also worked on <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/29/2/404/6375720?guestAccessKey=e585ef2b-9900-40ad-a21f-ece3b18feaf9">projects</a> related to trans healthcare.</p> 

<p>Before coming to Yale, I did my BS and MEng in <a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a> at MIT and did work that was a far cry from public health. You can reach me at a[dot]ram[at]yale[dot]edu. I'm particularly interested in talking to anyone working on matters surrounding harm reduction, incarceration, abolition and social determinants of health.</p>
