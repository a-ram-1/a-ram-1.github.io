<h2>A Ram</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm A. I'm a PhD student in Yale's Computational Biology and Bioinformatics program. I work with <a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/">Forrest Crawford</a>. I'm broadly interested in problems related to substance use and carceral spaces [prisons, halfway houses etc]. I've also worked on projects related to trans healthcare. 

Before coming to Yale, I did my BS and MEng in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. You can reach me at a[dot]ram[at]yale[dot]edu.</p>
