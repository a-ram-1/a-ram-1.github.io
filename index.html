<p>Hi, I'm A. I'm a PhD student in Yale's <a href=https://cbb.yale.edu/>Computational Biology and Bioinformatics</a> program working with <a href="http://www.crawfordlab.io/">Forrest Crawford</a>. I'm currently trying to identify sociodemographic determinants of opioid-related OD deaths across the state of Connecticut from 2009-2019 through a Bayesian spatiotemporal regression model. I've also worked on <a href=https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/29/2/404/6375720?guestAccessKey=e585ef2b-9900-40ad-a21f-ece3b18feaf9>projects</a> related to trans healthcare.</p> 

<p>Before coming to Yale, I did my BS and MEng in <a href=http://www.eecs.mit.edu/>Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a> at MIT. You can reach me at a[dot]ram[at]yale[dot]edu. I'm particularly interested in talking to anyone working on matters surrounding harm reduction, abolition, decarceration and social determinants of health, especially those with lived experience/doing work "on the ground" [so, people who aren't academics], so to speak.</p>
